        tox-travis is a simple plugin for tox that allows you to use
        Travis CI's multiple python version feature as well as tox's
        full configurability in a straightforward way.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Configure the Python versions to test with in ``travis.yml``:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            sudo: false
            language: python
            python:
              - "2.7"
              - "3.4"
            install: pip install tox-travis
            script: tox
        
        And it will run the appropriate testenvs,
        which by default are any declared env with
        ``py27`` or ``py34`` as factors of the name.
        If no environments match a given factor,
        the ``py27`` or ``py34`` envs are used as a fallback.
        
        
        Advanced Configuration
        ======================
        
        To customize what environments tox will run on Travis,
        add a section to ``tox.ini`` telling it what environments
        to run under which versions of Python:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [tox]
            envlist = py{27,34}-django{17,18}, docs
        
            [tox:travis]
            2.7 = py27
            3.4 = py34, docs
        
        This would run the Python 2.7 variants under 2.7,
        and the Python 3.4 variants and the ``docs`` env under 3.4.
        
        Note that Travis won't run all the envs simultaneously,
        because it's build matrix is only aware of the Python versions.
        Only one Travis build will be run per Python version,
        unless other settings are specified in the Travis build matrix.

        * Prefer ``TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION`` to sys.version_info (#14)
          - thanks to @jayvdb for the code review
        
        0.4 (2016-02-10)
        ++++++++++++++++
        
        * Generate default env from sys.version_info (#9)
          - thanks to @jayvdb for the bug report
        
        
        0.3 (2016-01-26)
        ++++++++++++++++
        
        * Match against testenvs that are only declared as sections (#7)
          - thanks to @epsy
        * Include unmatched envs verbatim to run (also #7)
          - thanks to @epsy again
        
        
        0.2 (2015-12-10)
        ++++++++++++++++
        
        * Choose testenvs from ``tox.ini`` by matching factors.
        
          * This is a slightly *backward incompatible* change
          * If a Python version isn't declared in the ``tox.ini``,
            it may not be run.
          * Additional envs may be run if they also match the factors,
            for example, ``py34-django17`` and ``py34-django18`` will
            both match the default for Python 3.4 (``py34``).
          * Factor matching extends to overrides set in ``tox.ini``.
